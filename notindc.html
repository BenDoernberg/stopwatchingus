<h3>2. Donate (and get perks!)</h3>

<p>We're running a campaign on Indiegogo that'll help fund the costs involved in running an event like this: things like hiring a sound system and stage, getting permits, and most importantly, getting buses from across the east coast to DC.<p>

    <h4 style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>Perks include:</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>T-shirts, hoodies, and stickers!</li>
        <li>Copies of the Pentagon Papers <strong>signed by Daniel Ellsberg</strong>.</li>
        <li>Autographed copies of reddit-cofounder Alexis Ohanian's book "Without Their Permission."</li>
    </ul><br />
