We use a Dropbox folder to share a Keepass database of passwords.
  (Taskforce/shared.kdb)

Keepass is like Lastpass or 1Password or Meldium or what have you, but it's a native app, is open source, and is free.

You can get it here:
  http://www.keepassx.org/downloads

Then open the database from the Dropbox (ask Sina).

It's protected by a master password -- and Sina knows it.
